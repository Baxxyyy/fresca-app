# fresca-app

Fresca is an app for android (and at some point IOS when apple will let me) that allows for users to enter the expiry dates for items that they buy.
The system then provides reminders for the users when items will go out of date for same day, tomorrow and 2-3 day items respectively.

The system also sends emails to a given email address daily, containing said items and when they will go off.

There are easy to use methods to add, delete, edit, and view the items currently stored by the system, to allow users to mange all aspects of their system.
